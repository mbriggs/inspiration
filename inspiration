  %|Most of the biggest problems in software are problems of misconception. - Rich Hickey|,
  %|Constraints are advantages in disguise. - 37 Signals|,
  %|Don't have good ideas if you aren't willing to be responsible for them. - Alan Perlis|,
  %|Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it. - Alan Perlis|,
  %|The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user. - C.A.R. Hoare|,
  %|Inside every large program, there is a small program trying to get out. - C.A.R. Hoare|,
  %|Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations. - Conway's Law|,
  %|Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's important. - D.H.H.|,
  %|Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction. - Sandi Metz|,
  %|A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it. - E.W. Dijkstra|,
  %|Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. - E.W. Dijkstra|,
  %|Good programmers don't just write programs. They build a working vocabulary. - Guy Steele|,
  %|Machines should work. People should think. - IBM Pollyanna Principle|,
  %|Good software, like wine, takes time. - Joel Spolsky|,
  %|Without great solitude no serious work is possible - Pablo Picasso|,
  %|No code is faster than no code. - Merb Motto|,
  %|A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds. - Ted Nelson|,
  %|Make it work first before you make it work fast. - Bruce Whiteside|,
  %|If you aren't sure which way to do something, do it both ways and see which works better. - John Carmack|,
  %|Premature optimizations can be troublesome to revert, but premature generalizations are often near impossible. - Emil Persson|,
  %|In programming, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve. - Paul Graham|,
  %|Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory loses. Every single time. - Linus Torvalds|,
  %|If we want users to like our software we should design it to behave like a likeable person: respectful, generous and helpful. - Alan Cooper|,
  %|The lurking suspicion that something could be simplified is the world's richest source of rewarding challenges. - Edsger Dijkstra|,
  %|The computing scientist's main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making. - E. W. Dijkstra|,
  %|If testing seems hard, there's something wrong with your design. - Sandi Metz|,
  %|Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. - Alan Kay|,
  %|Simplicity and elegance are unpopular because they require hard work and discipline to achieve and education to be appreciated. - E.W. Dijkstra|,
  %|Any fool can write code that a computer can understand.  Good programmers write code that humans can understand. - Martin Fowler|,
  %|The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise - Edsger Dijkstra|,
  %|Programming is an art form that fights back. - Unknown|,
  %|The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. - Joseph Weizenbaum|,
  %|The effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction [is] one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. - Edsger Dijkstra|,
  %|No matter how slow you are writing clean code, you will always be slower if you make a mess. - Uncle Bob Martin|,
  %|Good judgement is the result of experience. Experience is the result of bad judgement. - Fred Brooks|,
  %|Anything that can possibly go wrong, will go wrong. - Murphy's Law|,
  %|It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law. — Hofstadter's Law|,
  %|A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it. — Albert Einstein|,
  %|One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions. - Admiral Grace Hopper|
